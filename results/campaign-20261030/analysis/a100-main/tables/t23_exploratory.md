### exploratory (post-hoc; not in the locked design §9): Polars 2.0.0 CPU (side-study sessions) against the GPU engines of the main rounds, next to the locked-design contrasts

| Exploratory | Suite | Scale | Queries | Exploratory ratio [Welch 95% CI, unpaired] | Rounds (CPU side / GPU side) | Locked-design counterpart [t 95% CI over rounds] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

exploratory (post-hoc; not in the locked design §9). Ratio = time of the Polars CPU side-study sessions / time of the GPU side of the main rounds (above 1: the GPU side was faster, as for C1 and C4). Welch-type 95% interval on the log scale: the CPU times come from the side-study sessions and the GPU times from the main rounds, different sessions in different rounds, so the two sets of per-round values are unpaired (Welch-Satterthwaite df); no interval with fewer than two rounds on either side.
